# Image Classification
## An Introduction to Deep Learning

As a mathematics student, I find that I am very accustomed to a bottom-up approach to learning: working from the very base of knowledge into more complex ideas. That's why, when I first inquired into machine learning (particularly that of deep learning), I was intrigued by the [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/) course, 'Practical Deep Learning'. This introductory course takes a top-down approach, getting you stuck in and experimenting from the get go! This is definitely out of my comfort zone and so I decided it was the perfect fit for trying something new. 

However, what I thought was going to be a breezy introduction to this new concept, ended up being a self-led crash course in Linux environments, web development and even lead to me creating this blog! Whilst it took me longer than expected to finally launch my own image classifier, I am sure the skills I have learnt here will serve me as I continue forward.
