# About

My name is Amelie Sims and I am a third year Mathematics MMath student at the university of Warwick. Throughout my completed two years at university, I have develped a love for mathematical research and an interest in mathematical modelling for climate science. Whilst my studies give me an in-depth knowledge of the elements at the crux of these models, I am eager to develop skills in application- particularly in the construction and usage of neural networks for deep learning. I find these models to be incredibly interesting and, with the rapid development of machine learning, vital to the assessment of the climate and its preservation.

Here, you will find detailed recounts of my projects and processes as I explore the world of machine learning! :)
