Hi! Welcome to my blog: a comprehensive detailing of my personal projects and learning endeavours. Whilst I make this mostly for myself to keep track of my development, I hope that you can get something out of it- whether it's learning about *me* or even learning something yourself!

## Current Endeavours

Right now, I am beginning a study on practical deep learning via the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/).
